He assumes McAuliffes statement that ""its time"" to restore per-pupil funding in public schools to pre-recession levels is a vow to do that instantly. Then, Cuccinelli takes his assumptions and multiplies them by a stew of worst-case scenarios to come up with his unreliable tax estimate. We dont fault Cuccinelli for demanding specifics on McAuliffes agenda; the Democrat has addressed issues with a broad brush throughout the campaign. Its fair to ask how McAuliffe would accomplish his objectives and keep his word not to raise taxes. But that doesnt give Cuccinelli the license to create a platform for his rival."	emphasis

Sheldon Whitehouse said $47 billion raised by the Buffett Rule could finance 611,000 jobs for people rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. But that's not really 611,000 jobs. It's the equivalent of 61,100 people employed full-time for just one year. To get to 611,000, you'd have to fire those 61,000 at the end of the year and then rehire another 61,000, and do that for a total of 10 years. When we think of a job, it's not working for just one year. Also missing is the fact that these types of estimates -- even from reputable groups cited by both parties -- can vary widely. To his credit, Whitehouse was citing an estimate that translates into fewer jobs than what other sources say. But the certainty of his statement is undercut by the mushiness of the underlying economic projections. Ultimately, if everyone hired with this money stayed on the job for 10 years, Whitehouse would be off by a whopping 549,900 jobs. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.	distortion

Several analysts told us the best historical measure comes from looking at annual surpluses and deficits as a percentage of the nations GDP for a given year. By that gauge, although the U.

There are 36 states that use the federal exchange or state-federal partnerships instead of state-based marketplaces. But seven of those states are run by Democrats. And, some of the states with Republican governors, like New Mexico and Idaho, tried to institute a state exchange before opting for federally-facilitated marketplace. So while most of the 36 states had Republican governors, not all of them did.	distortion

There are only three examples to pick from since the Office of Congressional Ethics materialized in 2009. In one case  the case of Wilson yelling ""you lie!"" a formal reprimand came via a largely party-line resolution, not an ethics investigation, so no subcommittee was established. More importantly, Grayson omits that there are many other ways to discipline a member of Congress beyond formal sanctions. He also downplays that the House Ethics Committee kept his case open and could convene an investigative committee later."	distortion

There is a lot of uncertainty and experts  from advocates to economists  question whether Gardners proposal would be cheaper to most consumers or the health care system compared to the Affordable Care Act.

We agree he has made conflicting statements about his views on the health care bill -- once it only took him two hours to contradict himself.

The United States has added less jobs than a group of 35 other advanced economic nations combined, not more.

Advocates said Scott has a point about working to help around 5,000 disabled Floridians get off a narrow waiting list, but he left out two pieces of important context. First, the critical needs waiting list is a category that Scotts administration came up with about three years ago, so its not as if he had any historical competition. The state offered services to everyone on the critical needs list in 2014 and 2015, and Scott wants to do it again this year.

But he dramatically overreaches by saying the United States would be one of the largest Muslim countries in the world. Ranking 58 out of the world's 60 most populous Muslim nations does not a large Muslim country make. Indeed, by even the most generous estimate we found of 8 million, the United States still ranks 29 out of 60.	distortion

So in a year when Trump does not pay federal income taxes, which has been the case in the past, undocumented immigrants who do federal pay income taxes would pay more than him. But Clinton makes it seem as if this is a present state, and we dont know anything about Trumps current tax situation because he has not made his tax returns public. For that reason, we have no way of comparing Trumps federal income tax payments to those of any given undocumented immigrant."	unfounded

The post cited preliminary figures for 2015 that show crime rising. Our fact-check acknowledged the point made in the post, although this data is preliminary and subject to revision. Two criminologists we checked with before publication warned us that such data may not be indicative of a real trend. In addition, while the preliminary data shows spikes in crime rates in some cities, Trumps statement was broad, without qualifiers, and it came amid comments that painted an overarching image of a nation in decline. Trump didnt say that crime was rising ""recently"" or ""in recent months"" or ""over the past year"" or ""in some places.
