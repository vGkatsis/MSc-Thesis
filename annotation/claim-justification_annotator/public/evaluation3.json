        "justification": "Kaine said Allen, during his term in the Senate, was part of a Republican majority that turned the largest surplus in U. S.  history into the nations biggest deficit up until then. Kaine relied on raw numbers that do show the surplus peaked a few months before Allen took office and then dove into a record deficit during Allens term. But analysts said Kaines numbers -- which are unadjusted for inflation and do not take into account the size of the U. S.  economy at the time -- are a weak basis for historical comparison. Several analysts told us the best historical measure comes from looking at annual surpluses and deficits as a percentage of the nations GDP for a given year. By that gauge, although the U. S.  had high deficits during Allens term, they were not close to record-setting. So Kaines statement is accurate in terms of raw numbers, but it frays when historical context is added.",

        "justification": "Speaking generally about the state of the country, Trump said, \"Crime is rising. In fact, crime rates have been falling almost without fail for roughly a quarter-century. UPDATE, July 5, 2016: After we published our article, the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, published a blog post critiquing our analysis. The post cited preliminary figures for 2015 that show crime rising. Our fact-check acknowledged the point made in the post, although this data is preliminary and subject to revision. Two criminologists we checked with before publication warned us that such data may not be indicative of a real trend. In addition, while the preliminary data shows spikes in crime rates in some cities, Trumps statement was broad, without qualifiers, and it came amid comments that painted an overarching image of a nation in decline. Trump didnt say that crime was rising \"recently\" or \"in recent months\" or \"over the past year\" or \"in some places. \"Ultimately, we find that Trumps sweeping rhetoric about a nation in decline and beset by crime ignores the overall trend of violent and property crime rates over the past 25 years, which is that they have fallen, consistently and significantly.",

Boehner, as did Perry, made a valid point -- that a whole lot of money is spent on tax preparation in the United States today. But their numbers are not close to accurate, and a huge part of the dollar cost they mention is not money that anyone actually spends.
