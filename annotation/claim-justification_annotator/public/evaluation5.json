Its possible the entry-level salary for a trader was less than $43,000 in the 1980s, but Toomey was a trader at the forefront of the derivatives operation at Morgan Grenfell. So its likely he earned a significant bonus, which would put his earnings over that threshold. It gets less likely if we adjust Toomeys non-bonus-inflated potential salary for inflation.
